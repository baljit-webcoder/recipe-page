What I Learned
While working on this project, I improved my understanding of:

Using @font-face to import custom fonts like Young Serif and Outfit.
Implementing responsive design using media queries.
Using CSS variables and HSL color values to style elements effectively.
Centering images and applying responsive design with max-width and height: auto.
Hereâ€™s a sample of the font import:

css
Copy
Edit
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Young Serif';
  src: url('/YoungSerif-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
}
Continued Development
In the future, I want to focus on:

Enhancing accessibility with proper aria labels.
Exploring advanced CSS animations.
Improving responsiveness further for different screen sizes.
